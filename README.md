## Add your files

- [ ] [Create](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#create-a-file) or [upload](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/repository/web_editor.html#upload-a-file) files
- [ ] [Add files using the command line](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/gitlab-basics/add-file.html#add-a-file-using-the-command-line) or push an existing Git repository with the following command:

```
cd existing_repo
git remote add origin https://gitlab.com/MatkoCausic/bazaarbuddy.git
git branch -M main
git push -uf origin main
```

## Collaborative work on repository

To dynamically work on your repository in a group, you first must do the following:

```
git remote add main https://gitlab.com/MatkoCausic/bazaarbuddy.git
```

To put your work on the repository dynamically, use:

```
git merge main
```

To get the project with someone else's work, use:

```
git fetch main
```
